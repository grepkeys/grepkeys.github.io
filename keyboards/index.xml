Both these keyboards are 60% keyboards but still maintain everyone function a keyboard is required to fulfil.</description></item><item><title>Apple Wireless Keyboard</title><link>https://grepkeys.github.io/keyboards/applewirelesskeyboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://grepkeys.github.io/keyboards/applewirelesskeyboard/</guid><description>Membrane switch results in mediocre typing experience Size, weight and lack of cables results in great portability Only available refurbished or second hand Git gud and buy a real keyboard. Seriously though, it's not very good. The Apple Wireless Keyboard is a keyboard produced by Apple that ships with their desktop computers, but can also be bought separately. At least, it used to be. After many years, Apple decided that they wanted to update their keyboard offering, so they created the Magic Keyboard.</description></item><item><title>Corsair K95 RGB Platinum</title><link>https://grepkeys.github.io/keyboards/corsair-k95/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://grepkeys.github.io/keyboards/corsair-k95/</guid><description>Very expensive for what you get Over the top RGB lighting Requires Corsair's software that currently only supports Windows The Corsair K95 RGB Platinum is a keyboard produced by the popular PC hardware brand Corsair.

Ducky are well known for the great build quality of all their boards, an expectation that the Ducky One 2 series definitely lives up to. An example of this quality is the set of PBT Doubleshot keycaps that is standard amongst all boards in the series, as well as the frankly ridiculous range of Cherry MX switches they are available with (which is shown above).</description></item><item><title>Ducky Shine 7</title><link>https://grepkeys.github.io/keyboards/ducky-shine-7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://grepkeys.github.io/keyboards/ducky-shine-7/</guid><description>Exceptional build quality Expensive but better than everything else in the price range Only available with 100% size The Ducky Shine 7 is Ducky's top tier keyboard and is one of the best boards you can get without custom building a keyboard by yourself. This keyboard is currently only available as a 100% keyboard and has the exact same layout as the full size Ducky One 2 with three volume keys and a calculator key above the number pad.</description></item><item><title>Razer Blackwidow Elite</title><link>https://grepkeys.github.io/keyboards/razer-blackwidow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://grepkeys.github.io/keyboards/razer-blackwidow/</guid><description>Somewhat overpriced Great media control buttons Razer's software required The Razer Blackwidow Elite is the latest installment in Razer's series of Blackwidow keyboards.

Out of all of Razer's keyboards, this is the one with the most features such as a detachable wrist rest, RGB lights with many effects and ways to get more, keycaps that don't use a disgusting font, a gaming mode that disables the windows key and a programmable scroll wheel.</description></item></channel></rss>
