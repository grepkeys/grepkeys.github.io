Out of all of Razer&rsquo;s keyboards, this is the one with the most features such as a detachable wrist rest, RGB lights with many effects and ways to get more, keycaps that don&rsquo;t use a disgusting font, a gaming mode that disables the windows key and a programmable scroll wheel.</p><p>This keyboard is the one of two keyboards that can be bought with the Razer Purple switch. As described in the article for the <a href=/switches/razer-purple>Razer Opto-mechanical switch</a> this keyboard has been designed with a laser inside the switch that allows for increased durability and faster actuation.</p><p>Overall, there really isn&rsquo;t much to say about this keyboard. As far as I&rsquo;m aware, it&rsquo;s just a <a href=/keyboards/razer-blackwidow>Blackwidow Elite</a> with a newer type of switch and an extra $100 added to the price. For around $300 this keyboard is definitely not worth it unless you truly need an opto-mechanical switch. If you truly need Razer&rsquo;s newest switch, it is better to get a Razer Hunstman instead of the elite version. The main differences are the non-elite version doesn&rsquo;t have a wrist rest or dedicated media keys. Keep in mind, the difference between the two models is about $80. For that price, you could buy a wrist rest separately and still have spent less than if you just bought the Huntsman Elite.</p></main><footer><p>© GrepKeys 2019 · Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
