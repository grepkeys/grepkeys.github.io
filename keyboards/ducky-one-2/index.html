Ducky are well known for the great build quality of all their boards, an expectation that the Ducky One 2 series definitely lives up to. An example of this quality is the set of PBT Doubleshot keycaps that is standard amongst all boards in the series, as well as the frankly ridiculous range of Cherry MX switches they are available with (which is shown above). Continuing this theme of choice, the Ducky One 2 is sold in a myriad of colour schemes. Just to give a taste of the colour variations that are available: RGB, Horizon, Blue LED, White LED, Skyline, and the list goes on. In terms of size, on the other hand, there are &lsquo;only&rsquo; three options: one hundred percent, eighty percent, and Mini. Be prepared, however, that the Mini size will warrant a longer waiting time due to its immense popularity.</p><p>All of the keyboards in the Ducky One 2 series come with PBT Doubleshot keycaps for enhanced durability over typical ABS keycaps. PBT feels much nicer to the touch than ABS, picks up oil less easily and is more durable. &lsquo;Doubleshot&rsquo; means that the legend of each keycap is made from a separate piece of plastic, making fading impossible. In terms of nice touches, all keyboards in the range include a wire keycap puller in the box, while only RGB models come with extra keycaps for enter, WASD, escape and spacebar.</p><p>This keyboard is a part of Ducky's crossover with Razer. The Ducky One 2 is available in a special Razer edition that changes the bottom half of the keyboard's casing to be lime green and the keyboard comes with 10 green keycaps instead of the randomly coloured ones. It is through this edition of the Ducky One 2 that the keyboard can be obtained with Razer's exclusive switches and this is the only way to obtain Razer's switches on a board not made by them without desoldering switches from a Razer board.</p><p>Models with backlighting come with LEDs embedded in the PCB, with clear switch housings for the lights to shine through.</p><p>The purchase link we've supplied has all of the Ducky One 2 keyboards with all their switch types excluding the Razer edition and Razer switches.</p></main><footer><p>© GrepKeys 2019 · Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
