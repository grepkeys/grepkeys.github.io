The Blackwidow has always been Razer's main keyboard and has been through many iterations since its initial release in 2010. Between 2010 and now, many features have been added such as Razer Synapse™ support, Razer's own switches, RGB lighting, media keys and a removeable wrist rest.</p><p>The current model of the Razer Blackwidow Elite contains many of the above features. The benefits of buying this model of the Blackwidow over an older version include the media keys and scroll wheel on the top right of the board and it uses switches with Razer's new stem design. These new stems have walls around the edge that help keep dust out of the switch and potentially reduce keycap wobble. The Blackwidow Elite uses Razer Synapse for many of its features. Synapse allows for the RGB lights to be customised and for keys to be reprogrammed. This keyboard is one of the first keyboards to support Razer Hypershift. Hypershift allows for the keyboard to be layered so key combinations can activate macros while keeping the base layer to work as normal. The Blackwidow Elite also has USB 2.0 and audio passthrough but this requires. The scroll wheel is the main feature of this board. It is initially bound to be a volume scroll wheel but can be programmed to anything else through Synapse.</p><p>Just like Apple, Razer is a luxury brand. Their older products can be found for a decent price but their newest products will cost an arm and a leg to buy. This keyboard is an example of grossly overpriced products. When buying from Razer, you are generally paying for looks over function. The <a href=/contact>creators of GrepKeys</a> have come to an agreement that this keyboard really doesn't look too good due to its over the top <code>G A M E R Y A E S T H E T I C</code>. However, we believe that the font change on this keyboard compared to Razer's older keyboards is a step in the right direction but many people do somehow like the horrible fonts used on &lsquo;gaming&rsquo; keyboards. For around $250, this keyboard is priced at the high end of keyboards but definitely doesn't feel like a premium experience.</p><p>This keyboard is available for cheaper from vendors other than Amazon but we have chosen Amazon for our buy now link due to it being the easiest place to change switch preference.</p></main><footer><p>© GrepKeys 2019 · Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
