This website has been set up to help inform you about keyboards in an effort to assist you with buying your first keyboard. Each keyboard page contains a description of the features of the keyboard, the available switches, a sound test and a link to the place we recommend purchasing the keyboard.</p><p>So, after all this blurb, it might be time to introduce ourselves. <a href=https://github.com/twdly target=_blank>twdly</a> is a newly-forged mechanical keyboard enthusiast, having recently purchased his first board. Hence, he wrote most, if not all, of the website&rsquo;s content. <a href=https://github.com/arzg target=_blank>arzg</a>, on the other hand, knows very little about the subject matter, and wrote most of the <a href=https://github.com/grepkeys/website target=_blank>website&rsquo;s source code</a> (stealing a lot from his previous project with Hugo, <a href=https://arzg.github.io target=_blank>an unfinished blog</a>). We&rsquo;re both fans of graphic design, and typography in particular, which hopefully shows in GrepKeys&rsquo; layout.</p><p>Contrary to what you (hopefully) might think, GrepKeys was made as a school project for our software class. We would like to thank the creators of the tools we used to make this website, which are: <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank>Hugo</a> (a static site generator), <a href=https://git-scm.com target=_blank>Git</a>(<a href=https://github.com target=_blank>Hub</a>) for version control and collaboration respectively. twdly uses <a href=https://www.sublimetext.com/ target=_blank>Sublime Text</a>, and arzg uses <a href=https://neovim.io/ target=_blank>NeoVim</a> – you can find his configuration <a href=https://github.com/arzg/dotfiles target=_blank>here</a>. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, we use the Unix Shell to glue all these tools together. <a href=https://github.com/grepkeys/website/blob/master/deploy.sh target=_blank>Here</a> is an example of it in action.</p><p>Finally, make sure you remember that <em>the red switch is linear</em> (it&rsquo;s an inside joke &ndash; don&rsquo;t worry about it).</p></main><footer><p>© GrepKeys 2019 · Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
