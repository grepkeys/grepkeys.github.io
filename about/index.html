This website has been set up to help inform you about keyboards in an effort to assist you with buying your first keyboard.

Hence, he wrote most, if not all, of the website's content. <a href=https://github.com/arzg>arzg</a>, on the other hand, knows very little about the subject matter, and wrote most of the <a href=https://github.com/grepkeys/website>website's source code</a> (stealing a lot from his previous project with Hugo, <a href=https://arzg.github.io>an unfinished blog</a>). We're both fans of graphic design, and typography in particular, which hopefully shows in GrepKeys&rsquo; layout.</p><p>Contrary to what you (hopefully) might think, GrepKeys was made as a school project for our software class. We would like to thank the creators of the tools we used to make this website, which are: <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> (a static site generator), <a href=https://git-scm.com>Git</a>(<a href=https://github.com>Hub</a>) for version control and collaboration respectively. twdly uses <a href=https://www.sublimetext.com/>Sublime Text</a>, and arzg uses <a href=https://neovim.io/>NeoVim</a> – you can find his configuration <a href=https://github.com/arzg/dotfiles>here</a>. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, we use the Unix Shell to glue all these tools together. <a href=https://github.com/grepkeys/website/blob/master/deploy.sh>Here</a> is an example of it in action.</p><p>Finally, make sure you remember that <em>the red switch is linear</em> (it's an inside joke &ndash; don't worry about it).</p></main><footer><p>© GrepKeys 2019 · Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
