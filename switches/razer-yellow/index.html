It was designed almost identically to the <a href=/switches/cherry-speed>Cherry MX Speed</a> but can only be found inside Razer's own keyboards. Just like the MX Speed, this switch is linear, has an actuation distance of 1.2 millimetres and an actuation force of forty-five grams. This results in the switch having the same problem as the MX Speed being the low actuation point causing accidental keystrokes.</p><p>This switch has only a few differences when compared to the MX Speed. This switch has a different coloured stem (yellow instead of the MX Speed's silver) and Razer's apparent durability increase. Razer claims this switch will last approximately 80 million keystrokes while Cherry estimates their switches to work for 50 million. However, this durability difference doesn't mean much because Cherry says that the 50 million keystrokes is only what they have tested their switches to. According to Cherry, after the 50 million keystrokes, their switches will work just as well or better than when they were new. Razer, on the otherhand, has not made this same claim and therefore it is indeterminate whether their switches do outlast Cherry's.</p></main><footer><p>© GrepKeys 2019 · Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
