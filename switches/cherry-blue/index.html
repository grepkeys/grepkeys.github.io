It has an operating force of fifty grams, which is little compared to heavier switch versions such as the <a href=/switches/cherry-green>Cherry MX Green</a>, but still more than the forty-five grams of the <a href=/switches/cherry-red>Cherry MX Red</a>. Blues have an actuation point of 2.2 millimetres, again more than the Reds. The tactile bump is significantly more noticeable than the <a href=/switches/cherry-brown>Browns</a>&rsquo; ones. In fact, the difference is so pronounced that doubts have been raised about the tactile status of Browns in the first place. Anyways, I&rsquo;m getting off track here.</p><p>In conclusion, the tactility and (relatively) heavy operating force have resulted in the Cherry MX Blue being favoured for typing over gaming.</p><figure><video controls>
