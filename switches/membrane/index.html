The membrane switch is known for being dirt cheap for manufacturers due to having a single membrane spread over the entire board. This cheapness from not needing a switch for every key has resulted in this switch being used in the vast majority of keyboards. If you buy a keyboard that doesn&rsquo;t advertise a specific switch nor say it is mechanical, you almost definitely have just found a membrane keyboard.</p><p>Back to the paradox of membrane keyboards being the most and least popular switch, due to membrane switches being the cheapest and most common keyboard switch, many unaware people have fallen victim to the vile membrane switch. They are unknowingly typing on what is generally regarded as one the worst switches when it comes to the feeling of the switch. The membrane switches are also the least popular switch among people who are aware of mechanical keyboards. These people absolutely hate having to type on membrane keyboards and will do just about anything to escape having to write on a membrane keyboard.</p><p>Overall, membrane switches are only used because of their cheap manufacturing cost. A small rubber dome with a membrane underneath is significantly cheaper than making individual switches for each key. Membrane keyboards will generaly be cheaper than mechanical keyboards and have three main uses: typing on them temporarily on a new system until you get a mechanical keyboard for it, a cheap, budget option for a keyboard if you don&rsquo;t want to spend more than $100 on a keyboard or for destroying because one less membrane keyboard in existence means one less person will be tortured by the disgusting mushiness of the inferior switch.</p></main><footer><p>© GrepKeys 2019 · Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
