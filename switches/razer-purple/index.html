When the switch is idle, a laser is blocked by a part of the slider just above the spring. When the switch is pressed down, the part blocking the laser is also moved down allowing the laser to shine into a sensor that then registers the keystroke. The laser actuation mechanicanism has too benefits, a shorter actuation distance and less moving parts resulting in a longer lifespan for the switch. This switch is similar in terms of weigth and actuation to the <a href=/switches/cherry-brown>Cherry MX Brown</a> except the Razer purple has a slightly lowered actuation distance of 1.5 millimetres compared to the MX Brown&rsquo;s 2 millimetres.</p><p>Just like all other Razer switches, this switch is only available in Razer&rsquo;s own keyboards. However, unlike the other switches, this switch isn&rsquo;t available in the Ducky One 2 Razer Edition. A combination of this switch being relatively new and it being a Razer exclusive switch has led it to be one of the rarest mainstream switches in terms of how many different keyboards it is available in. The Razer purple is currently only available in the Razer Huntsman and the Razer Huntsman Elite.</p></main><footer><p>© GrepKeys 2019 · Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
