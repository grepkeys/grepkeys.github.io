The silent reds were designed to feel and function identically to the Cherry MX Reds but quiter. The reason for developing this switch instead of just using O-rings (small rubber bands placed onto the bottom of a keycap to dampen sound) was that the O-rings would possibly block the RGB lights. Just like the other red switch, the silent reds have an actuation force of forty-five grams and are completely linear.</p><p>The Cherry MX Silent Red is the ideal switch for somebody who wants to get started with mechanical keyboards without having to worry about buying and applying O-rings while also having a quiet keyboard that won&rsquo;t disturb anyone nearby</p></main><footer><p>© GrepKeys 2019 · Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
