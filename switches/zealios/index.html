The Holy Panda is known for being the most tactile switch that is available today. A combination of its tactility and it only being available during a group buy that occurs just a couple of times a year (maybe even less) the resell price has raised to about $6 for a single switch. So where does the Zealios V2 fit in? The Zealios V2 tries to fill a similar niche as the Holy Panda being a tactile switch that cannot be bought in prebuilt keyboards and is only available if you are willing to build the keyboard yourself or pay someone else to build it for you.</p><p>The Zealios V2 is a highly tactile switch that allows the user to choose the bottom-out weight when they purchase their switches. They are available in four weights: 62g, 65g, 67g and 72g. Each of these different weights have a couple of things in common. They are all highly tactile with the bump quite close to the top and they are compatible in Cherry MX style builds. These switches are much more readily available than Holy Pandas due to them being priced at $1.50 a switch and they are easily bought through ZealPC directly.</p></main><footer><p>© GrepKeys 2019 · Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
