The Razer Green switch is essentially just a slightly worse <a href=/switches/cherry-blue/>Cherry MX Blue</a>. This switch keeps the distinct clicky noise of the MX Blue but loses the tactility. People who have used this switch report the bump as feeling like the <a href=/switches/cherry-brown>Cherry MX Brown&rsquo;s</a> bump.</p><p>Razer originally used MX Blues in all their boards until they deigned the Razer Greens. They claimed that their green switches were &lsquo;designed for gaming&rsquo; however their motivation was most likely cutting production costs. When the switches first debuted in earlier iterations of Razer&rsquo;s Blackwidow keyboards, the switches were most likely being produced by Kailh; a company known for creating switches to compete with Cherry&rsquo;s. Because Razer was cutting costs and making Kailh produce their switches, early green switches were failing very quickly. Since their initial release, Razer Greens have improved significantly. Newer Razer Greens have a wall around the edge of the switch similar to Kailh&rsquo;s box switches in order to reduce keycap wobble and increase durability.</p><p>Razer has reported that their Green switches have a lifespan of 80 million keystrokes but this has met some criticism. Many switches have reportedly died long before then while others claim that Razer&rsquo;s low quality keycaps are a bottleneck towards the switch&rsquo;s lifetime. Razer keyboards generally use ABS laser-etched keycaps. These are some of the cheapest, least durable keycaps available. This results in the legend on the keycap fading away causing two things to occur. The keycap will look horrible when the top has worn away and many people new to mechanical keyboards will believe they need a new keyboard.</p><figure><video controls>
